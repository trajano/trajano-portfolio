# trajano-portfolio

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/trajano/trajano-portfolio.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/trajano/trajano-portfolio)

My portfolio site of Archimedes Trajano.

This is built using webpack and [MaterializeCSS](http://materializecss.com/).

# Installation

`npm install`

This will run `webpack -p` to build the resulting site in the `dist` folder.

# Development mode

`npm start`

This will start up a server on http://localhost:8080/ that will show the portfolio site.  It is configured to automatically refresh the page when there is a change in the application.
